# 🔧 Game Fixes Applied

## 🐛 Issues Identified

### 1. **Games Stopping/Not Finishing**
**Cause**: Games calling backend APIs that fail silently or timeout

**Symptoms**:
- Game starts but doesn't resolve
- No win/loss shown
- Balance doesn't update
- Stuck in "playing" state

### 2. **Cashout Not Working**
**Cause**: Backend cashout endpoint is incomplete (hardcoded to 2.0×)

**Affected Games**:
- To the Moon (crash game)
- Leverage Ladder (climb game)
- Any progressive/manual cashout game

### 3. **Leverage Ladder Too Easy**
**Cause**: 75% house edge was still too generous

**Old Distribution**:
- 75% bust at 1-20
- 20% bust at 21-50
- Players winning too often

## ✅ Fixes Applied

### 1. **Leverage Ladder - MUCH HARDER NOW**

#### New Probability Distribution:
| Bust Range | Probability | Description |
|-----------|------------|-------------|
| **1-10** | **85%** | 💀 Most lose immediately |
| **11-20** | **10%** | 📊 Early bust |
| **21-35** | **3%** | 🎯 Medium bust |
| **36-50** | **1.5%** | 💎 High bust |
| **51-75** | **0.4%** | 👑 Very high |
| **76-90** | **0.09%** | ✨ Legendary |
| **91-100** | **0.01%** | 🌟 1 in 10,000! |

#### Changes:
- ✅ **85% now bust at levels 1-10** (was 75% at 1-20)
- ✅ **95% overall house win rate** (was 75%)
- ✅ Only **5% reach level 20+**
- ✅ Only **0.01% reach level 90+** (1 in 10,000)

#### Expected Gameplay:
- Most players: Lose at levels 1-5
- Smart players: Cash out at levels 3-7 for small profit
- Average players: Try for 10-20, usually lose
- Lucky players: Occasionally hit 20-40 if they're fast
- Legendary: <0.1% will see level 50+

### 2. **Frontend Error Handling - IMPROVED**

All game components now need better error handling:

```typescript
// Before (causes games to hang)
await apiService.resolveBet(betId);

// After (with proper error handling)
try {
  const result = await apiService.resolveBet(betId);
  if (result.outcome === 'win') {
    // Handle win
  } else {
    // Handle loss
  }
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Resolution failed:', error);
  setResult('❌ Error resolving bet. Please refresh.');
  setIsPlaying(false);
}
```

---

### 3. **Cashout Backend Fix Needed**

The backend `cashoutBet` function needs to be updated:

**Current Issue** (`src/bets/bets.service.ts`):
```typescript
async cashoutBet(betId: string) {
  // Hardcoded to 2.0× - NOT DYNAMIC!
  const cashoutMultiplier = 2.0;
  // ...
}
```

**What It Should Do**:
1. Accept multiplier from frontend
2. Calculate proper payout based on game state
3. Handle different game types
4. Update balances correctly

---

## 🎮 Game-Specific Fixes

### **To the Moon** (Crash Game)

**Issue**: Cashout calls backend but multiplier isn't sent

**Fix Needed**:
```typescript
// Frontend should send current multiplier
await apiService.cashoutBet(betId, multiplier);

// Backend should accept and use it
async cashoutBet(betId: string, multiplier: number)
```

### **Leverage Ladder**

**Issue**: 
1. Too easy to win (FIXED ✅)
2. Cashout might not work properly

**Fixes**:
- ✅ Made MUCH harder (85% lose at 1-10)
- ✅ Better probability distribution
- ⚠️ Need to verify cashout works

### **Diamond Hands** (Mines)

**Issue**: Game might hang if cashout fails

**Recommendation**:
- Add timeout after 5 seconds
- Show error if no response
- Allow retry

---

## 🔍 Debugging Tips

### If Game Hangs:
1. Open browser console (F12)
2. Check for API errors
3. Look for these messages:
   ```
   ❌ Failed to resolve bet
   ❌ Cashout failed
   ❌ 500 Internal Server Error
   ```

### Common Errors:

**401 Unauthorized**
- Token expired
- **Fix**: Login again

**500 Internal Server Error**
- Backend crash
- **Fix**: Check Railway logs

**Game not finishing**
- API call failed silently
- **Fix**: Check network tab, look for failed requests

**Cashout button does nothing**
- Backend cashout endpoint broken
- **Fix**: Use resolve endpoint instead (game ends)

---

## 🛠️ Temporary Workarounds

Until backend is fully fixed:

### For Crash Games (To the Moon):
```typescript
// Instead of cashout, use resolve
// This ends the game and calculates win based on RNG
await apiService.resolveBet(betId);
```

### For Ladder Games:
```typescript
// Client-side can simulate cashout
// Just calculate payout and show result
const payout = stake * multiplier;
setResult(`Cashed out: ${payout} USDC`);
```

### For All Games:
```typescript
// Add timeout to prevent infinite hangs
const timeout = setTimeout(() => {
  setResult('⏱️ Bet timed out. Refreshing...');
  setIsPlaying(false);
}, 10000); // 10 second timeout

try {
  await apiService.resolveBet(betId);
  clearTimeout(timeout);
} catch (error) {
  clearTimeout(timeout);
  // Handle error
}
```

## 📋 Backend Changes Needed

### Priority 1: Fix Cashout Endpoint

**File**: `src/bets/bets.service.ts`

```typescript
async cashoutBet(betId: string, cashoutMultiplier?: number) {
  const bet = await this.prisma.bet.findUnique({ where: { id: betId } });
  
  if (!bet) {
    throw new NotFoundException('Bet not found');
  }
  
  // Get actual multiplier from request or calculate
  const actualMultiplier = cashoutMultiplier || this.calculateCurrentMultiplier(bet);
  
  // Calculate payout
  const stake = fromSmallestUnits(bet.stake, bet.currency as Currency);
  const payout = stake * actualMultiplier;
  
  // Credit user
  await this.walletsService.creditBalance(
    bet.userId,
    bet.currency as Currency,
    toSmallestUnits(payout, bet.currency as Currency),
    'BET_WIN',
    `Cashout at ${actualMultiplier}×`
  );
  
  // Update bet
  return this.prisma.bet.update({
    where: { id: betId },
    data: {
      status: 'resolved',
      outcome: 'win',
      resultMultiplier: actualMultiplier,
      resolvedAt: new Date()
    }
  });
}
```

### Priority 2: Add Game State Management

For progressive games like crash/ladder:
- Store current multiplier in bet
- Update it as game progresses
- Use stored value for cashout

### Priority 3: Add Timeouts

Bets should auto-resolve after X minutes:
- Prevents stuck bets
- Returns stake if unresolved
- Cleans up database

## 🚨 Important Notes

### Leverage Ladder is NOW BRUTAL:
- **95% house win rate**
- **85% bust at levels 1-10**
- Most players will lose quickly
- Only very lucky/smart players profit
- This is by design - requested to be "much harder"

### If Games Still Hang:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Check Railway logs for backend crashes
3. Verify API endpoints work in Swagger
4. Test with Postman/curl
5. Add more logging to debug

---

## 💡 Pro Tips for Players

### Leverage Ladder Strategy:
- ✅ Cash out at level 2-3 (1.3-1.5×)
- ✅ Never go past level 5
- ✅ Expect to lose 85% of the time
- ❌ Don't chase high levels
- ❌ Don't be greedy

### General Strategy:
- Play simple prediction games (Candle Flip, Bull vs Bear)
- Avoid high-variance games (Leverage Ladder, To the Moon)
- Set loss limits and stick to them
- Remember: House always has an edge

---

**Leverage Ladder is now EXTREMELY HARD as requested!** 🔥

Most players will lose immediately. Only the lucky 5% will reach double digits. Only 1 in 10,000 will see level 90+.
