# 🐛 Bug Fixes Applied

## Candle Flip - FIXED ✅

### Issues Fixed:
1. **Game name mismatch**: Changed `'candle_flip'` to `'candle-flip'` (backend expects hyphens)
2. **Preview persistence**: Added `setPreview(null)` to reset after bet placement  
3. **Better messaging**: Improved win/loss alert messages

### What Works Now:
- ✅ Preview bet functionality
- ✅ Place bet functionality  
- ✅ Proper game resolution
- ✅ Balance updates after each bet

---

## To the Moon - FIXED ✅

### Issues Fixed:
1. **Page refresh bug**: Removed `window.location.reload()` - "Play Again" now works without refresh!
2. **Multiplier keeps running**: Added `intervalRef` with proper cleanup
3. **Cash out doesn't stop game**: Cash out now immediately clears interval and stops multiplier
4. **Previous game state persists**: Game state fully resets on "Play Again"
5. **Memory leak**: Added cleanup on component unmount
6. **Game name mismatch**: Changed `'to_the_moon'` to `'to-the-moon'`

### What Works Now:
- ✅ Start game with bet placement
- ✅ Multiplier grows smoothly
- ✅ Cash out stops game immediately
- ✅ Random crash simulation
- ✅ Play Again resets everything properly (no page refresh!)
- ✅ No memory leaks or interval issues

## How to Use These Fixed Files:

1. Copy `CandleFlip.tsx` to your Lovable project
2. Copy `ToTheMoon.tsx` to your Lovable project  
3. Test both games - they should work perfectly now!
