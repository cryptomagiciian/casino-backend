# 🔧 Trading Terminal Balance Fix

## ❌ **Problem**
The trading terminal was showing "invalid amount or insufficient funds" even when users had funds, because it wasn't using the same balance system as the working games like Diamond Hands.

## ✅ **Solution**
Updated the trading terminal to use the same balance system as Diamond Hands:

### **1. Fixed Balance Loading**
```typescript
// OLD (incorrect parameters)
const balance = await getBalance(bettingCurrency, network);

// NEW (correct parameters like Diamond Hands)
const balance = await getBalance(bettingCurrency);
```

### **2. Added Balance Refresh on Network/Currency Changes**
```typescript
// Refresh balance when network or currency changes (like Diamond Hands)
useEffect(() => {
  loadBalance();
}, [network, bettingCurrency, loadBalance]);
```

### **3. Enhanced Balance Checking**
```typescript
// Check balance using the same system as Diamond Hands
console.log(`💰 Trading Balance Check: $${availableBalance} USD vs $${amount} USD stake`);
console.log(`💰 Sufficient funds? ${availableBalance >= amount ? 'YES' : 'NO'}`);

if (amount <= 0 || amount > availableBalance) {
  alert(`❌ Insufficient balance! You have $${availableBalance.toFixed(2)} USD but need $${amount.toFixed(2)} USD`);
  setIsTrading(false);
  return;
}
```

### **4. Better Error Messages**
- Clear balance information in error messages
- Shows exactly how much user has vs needs
- Uses same emoji style as Diamond Hands

## 🎯 **Result**
- ✅ **Correct Balance**: Uses same system as working games
- ✅ **Real-time Updates**: Balance refreshes on network/currency changes
- ✅ **Clear Errors**: Shows exact balance vs required amount
- ✅ **Consistent UX**: Same behavior as Diamond Hands

**The trading terminal now uses the exact same balance system as Diamond Hands!** 🎯💰
