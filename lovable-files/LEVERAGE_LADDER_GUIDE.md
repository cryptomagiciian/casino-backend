## 💡 Pro Tips

### 1. **Cash Out Early & Often** 🧠
Most players lose by being greedy. The house has a 75% edge, so:
- Cash out at level 5-10 for consistent small wins
- Don't chase the big multiplier
- Smart money takes profit early

### 2. **Bankroll Management** 💰
- Never bet more than 1-5% of your balance
- Expect to lose 75% of games on average
- Your wins need to cover multiple losses

### 3. **Understand the Math** 📊
To break even with 75% house edge:
- If you lose 3/4 games at 10 USDC each = -30 USDC
- You need to win 30 USDC on the 1/4 games you cash out
- That requires cashing out at ~3× minimum
- But remember: only 25% of games let you reach level 10+

### 4. **Psychological Traps** 🧘
- **Gambler's Fallacy**: Past results don't affect future odds
- **Sunk Cost**: Don't chase losses by going higher
- **Greed**: The #1 killer - take profit when you can
- **Tilt**: After a loss, you're more likely to take dumb risks

## 🧮 House Edge Breakdown

**Why 75% house edge?**

The bust distribution ensures:
- 75% of games bust before level 20 (low multipliers)
- 20% bust between 21-50 (medium multipliers)
- 4% bust between 51-80 (high multipliers)
- 1% make it past 80 (ultra high multipliers)

**This means:**
- Most players lose quickly (levels 1-20)
- Smart players cash out early (levels 5-15) and profit
- Greedy players chase high levels and usually lose
- Very few players reach the insane multipliers

**The 25% who "win" (reach 20+)** still need to cash out before their random bust level to actually profit!

## 🎲 RNG & Fairness

### How Bust Level is Determined:
1. Random number generated (0-1)
2. Applied to weighted probability ranges
3. Bust level calculated client-side (visible in console)
4. Provably fair verification available

### Console Logs:
Open browser console (F12) to see:
```
🎲 Game started - Bust at level 15
🎯 Nice! Level 10 reached - 4× multiplier
💥 LIQUIDATED! (or)
💰 Cashed out at level 12!
```

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### This is Entertainment, Not Investment
- The house ALWAYS has an edge
- You WILL lose more games than you win
- Smart play = cash out early for small consistent wins
- Chasing big multipliers = fast way to lose

### Expected Losses
With 75% house edge:
- Expect to lose 75 out of 100 games
- Your 25 wins need to cover those 75 losses
- Unless you cash out at 4×+, you'll lose money overall

### Play Responsibly
- Set a budget and stick to it
- Never bet more than you can afford to lose
- Take breaks if you're on a losing streak
- Remember: it's a game, not income
