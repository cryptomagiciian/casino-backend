# 💰 Deposit & Withdrawal Setup Guide

## 🎯 What You Need to Do

Your backend is working perfectly! The issue is that your frontend doesn't have deposit/withdrawal components yet. Here's how to add them:

---

## 📦 **Step 1: Copy These Files to Your Lovable Project**

Copy these files to your Lovable project:

```
src/components/wallet/
├── DepositForm.tsx          ← lovable-files/DepositForm.tsx
├── WithdrawalForm.tsx       ← lovable-files/WithdrawalForm.tsx
└── WalletManager.tsx        ← lovable-files/WalletManager.tsx
```

---

## 🚀 **Step 2: Add to Your App**

### Option A: Add to Navigation
Add a "Wallet" link to your navigation that opens the `WalletManager` component.

### Option B: Add to Existing Page
Import and use the `WalletManager` component in any existing page:

```tsx
import { WalletManager } from './components/wallet/WalletManager';

// In your component:
<WalletManager />
```

## 🎮 **Step 3: Test the Flow**

### **Deposit Flow:**
1. **Click "Deposit" tab**
2. **Select currency** (BTC, ETH, SOL, USDC, USDT)
3. **Enter amount** (minimum amounts apply)
4. **Select network** (testnet for testing, mainnet for real funds)
5. **Click "Create Deposit"**
6. **Copy the generated address** and send crypto to it
7. **Backend will automatically detect** and credit your account

### **Withdrawal Flow:**
1. **Click "Withdraw" tab**
2. **Select currency** and **enter amount**
3. **Enter destination address**
4. **Select network**
5. **Click "Create Withdrawal"**
6. **Backend will process** the withdrawal automatically

## 🔧 **What's Already Working:**

✅ **Backend API** - All deposit/withdrawal endpoints are live
✅ **Real crypto addresses** - Generated using proper HD wallets
✅ **Blockchain monitoring** - Automatically detects deposits
✅ **Security** - 2FA and withdrawal passwords supported
✅ **Multiple currencies** - BTC, ETH, SOL, USDC, USDT
✅ **Testnet support** - Safe testing environment

---

## 🎯 **Quick Test:**

1. **Create a deposit** for 0.001 BTC on testnet
2. **Copy the generated address**
3. **Send testnet BTC** to that address
4. **Wait for confirmations** (backend monitors automatically)
5. **Check your balance** - it should update!

---

## 🚨 **Important Notes:**

- **Testnet first** - Always test with testnet before using mainnet
- **Minimum amounts** - Each currency has minimum deposit amounts
- **Fees** - Withdrawals have network fees
- **Confirmations** - Deposits need blockchain confirmations
- **Security** - Your private keys are secure and never exposed

---

## 🎉 **You're Ready!**

Once you add these components, your users will be able to:
- ✅ **Deposit real crypto** into their accounts
- ✅ **Withdraw to their wallets**
- ✅ **Play games with real money**
- ✅ **Full Web3 casino experience**

The backend is production-ready and secure! 🔒✨
